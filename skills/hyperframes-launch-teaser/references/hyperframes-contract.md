# HyperFrames timing contract

This excerpt reproduces the first eight contract rules from the [HyperFrames skill](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes/blob/b96c82b785ab8fbd9c030c093de9c39e5dc39342/skills/hyperframes/SKILL.md), licensed under Apache-2.0. See the repository LICENSE and NOTICE.

1. Every timed element has `class="clip"`, `data-start` and `data-duration` in seconds, and shows over `[start, start + duration)`: land an end state just before its end. `data-track-index` is only a Studio lane; paint order is `z-index`.
2. The video's length is the root's `data-duration`: overrun is cut, an early end holds the last frame.
3. Each composition builds one paused timeline and registers it after its tweens: `window.__timelines["<data-composition-id>"] = tl`.
4. No `Date.now()`, unseeded `Math.random()`, network fetches, timers or `repeat: -1`. Everything visible is a function of timeline time.
5. Never tween `display`, `visibility` or `autoAlpha` on a `.clip`; animate a child.
6. No CSS `transform` on an element GSAP transforms; animate transforms, not `left`/`top`/`width`/`height`.
7. Never `play()`, `pause()` or seek media. A `<video>` keeps its sound with `data-has-audio="true"`, else it is `muted`; music, voice, replacement sound and J/L cuts are a separate `<audio>`.
8. Every `<audio>` has an `id` or it is left out of the mix. No `crossorigin` on media. Time the `<video>`, never its wrapper.
